### My Background

I am a computer science student at BYU-Idaho. In high school I did some of the code.org exercises and took one programing class in high school, but never caught the vision of what programing is. I then took an intro class in the Winter of 2021 and got hooked. Take a look around on this website to see what I'm working on!

### Skills

    - I do inspections and report the results using WEBtma software. I ensure that any problems that need repairing are fix working with the school's repair shops. I then create a report on the cost, frequency, and location of these problems.

I also help write a 10 year plan document and assist with other smaller projects. 
- **Construction Worker - Sam Savant Flooring - Jan 2022 - April 2022**
    - Took a break from school to work with a team to cut and polish Walmart floors. We would go in to a Walmart durning the night, move merchandise, tear up any tile or wood floor, and cut and polish the concrete underneath. 
- **Pest Control Technician  - Pure Defense Pest Solutions - Apr 2020 July 2020**
    - In between finishing a volunteer mission trip in Philadelphia (2018-2020) and before starting school again at BYU-Idaho, I would apply pest control to customers homes. I would explained it's purpose and would occasionally upsell products to better fit their needs.
