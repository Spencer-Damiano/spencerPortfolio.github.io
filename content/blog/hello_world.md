### Hello world!

This is my portfolio website and blog. This website has three main objectives.

- Be a professional record of the things that I learn and commentary on trends in the computer science world. 
- Serve as a place to further explain and share personal projects.
- Advertise myself to potential employers.

The projects that I am working on will receive blog posts of their own with an explanation of what I hope to do with them as well as a timeline for each project. 

I plan on updating the blog weekly with a 'status update' with the progress that I've made on my projects as well as things that I've learned that week.

Thank you for checking out my website and following me on this journey!
