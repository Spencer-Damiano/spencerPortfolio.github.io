### Bird-geoisie NFT Project

My first NFT Project.

##### Objectives

1. To create a project that does not have to justify it's existence. I don't just want to clone another projects because it'll be a slightly worst version of what ever I copy. When I take inspiration from another project I'll acknowledge where I got the idea from and have to improve or put my twist on it.
2. To test and learn how to make a NFT with high utility. Meaning how multi-use can we make these little birds? What things will I think are going to be most useful?
2. To experiment into the web 3 and dapp world to see if this is some side projects and portfolio pieces or a career as blockchain developer.

##### Why Bird-geoisie?

This project is based off a strange situation that happened to me while waiting for a bus. It happened while living in Philadelphia. I was walking around waiting for my bus at Frankford Transportation station and this pigeon was acting like he was following me around. I didn't have any food or anything on me and thought it was strange. Bored waiting for the bus, I got a curious enough about this bird to walk over to it. The bird hesitantly flew a couple of feet away towards some of his pigeon friends. I kept the bird in the corner of my eye thinking about the conspiracy theory that birds are actually robots created by the government to spy on people. As pondering the merits of such an idea, the pigeon *and one of his bird friends* starts walking back over. I then had this strange image of me running around this transportation station among cars, buses, pedestrians, and trains trying to hit these birds with my bag. I then thought "that'd be a fun video game." I would think about making that a game when I would get bored over the next couple of months but then it slowly faded away.

I did talk to my brother about a cat-and-mouse-esk video game trying to knock a robot bird controlled by your friend out of the sky about a year later but that was before I started to learn to code or even had plans to learn how to code.

About a year and a half after the conversation with my brother and over two years after that initial interaction with those pigeons in Philadelphia I started to seriously learn about blockchain technology and it's possible use cases. Believing that experience is the master teacher I started to dream up possible projects. I wanted something serious enough that it would teach me but fun enough not to feel like a chore. I then thought of the pigeons who were following me those years ago and decided that those pigeons would be my project.

One day I realized that birdgeoisie would be a fun play off of bourgeoisie and that I had the name of the project. I figured now that the name had come to me it was time to seriously start building the project.  

##### Technical aspects

One reason that I took so long to start developing this project was I had to learn the overview of how a blockchain works and which one I wanted to develope on. I started to think about developing this on the Ethereum network but the high gas fees got me looking else where. I started to look around and then found Cardano. I'll probably write my blog post about why I am currently betting on Cardano, but the main reason is I think the foundation of Cardano is the strongest of any blockchain. Additionally, I think that their smart contract security is stronger and trust their development community more.

I also picture that before 2022 is done the following milestone will be meet:

1. Birdgeoisie Website and marketplace
2. Birdgeosisie Binary Breeding program.
    - Creating new NFT's through 'breeding' similar to cryptokittes.
3. Have a video game in alpha development.

I do not plan on having this project be truly decentralized. I want to leave that door open but that is only if the project becomes a full time job, which as great as that sounds, is not what I am pursuing. 

More updates to come soon!
